== Intramurals Notifier

Tired of polling your teammates on Facebook to ask if they're coming to one of your teams' intramurals game? Don't want to make a facebook event for every intramural game your team has? If so, then Intramurals Notifier is the web app for you. It will email all your teammates for you reminding them everytime a game is coming up and ask for their response so you can get a quick headcount easily.This is my first Ruby on Rails project that is currently in progress and I will try to give notifications through text and get responses through text as well.
